# The Open Cookbook

A full stack CRUD application that allows users to register and log in to create, edit, update and delete recipes.

This application uses Python on the back-end with the Flask web framework, and uses MongoDB for the database. It also uses the Materialize framework on the front-end.

Built for Milestone Project no.4 in the Full Stack Software Development bootcamp at Code Institute, in the Data Centric Development module.

The live project can be viewed [here](https://www.heroku.com/).


## UX
 
This application was built to allow users create and share recipes, as well as updating and deleting them as necessary. The application provides a registration page for new users to register on the site, and a log in page to sign in after they have registered. Any visitor can browse the recipes created on the site but logged in users, aside from adding, editing and deleting recipes, can upvote recipes using the "like" button system.

When viewing all the recipes on the site the user can search recipes by name user a free text input and can sort all recipes available on the site by alphabetical order, ascending or descending, or by cuisine type using a cuisine select drop-down menu. There is also a reset button to reset your browsing filter or sorting to reset the list back to its default state.

##### User Stories

This site was built on the basis of ideas from initial wireframes created in Adobe XD and exported image file for this can be seen below. These image files as well as the XD project file can be found in the main project folder:
