# The Open Cookbook

A data full stack CRUD application that allows users to register and log in to create, edit, update and delete recipes.

This application uses Python on the back-end with the Flask web framework, and uses MongoDB for the database. It also uses the Materialize framework on the front-end.

Built for Milestone Project no.4 in the Full Stack Software Development bootcamp at Code Institute, in the Data Centric Development module.


## UX
 
This application was built to allow users create and share recipes, as well as updating and deleting them as necessary. The application provides a registration page for new users to register on the site, and a log in page to sign in after they have registered. Any visitor can browse the recipes created on the site but logged in users, aside from adding, editing and deleting recipes can upvote recipes using the "like" button system.
